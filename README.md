## [Brief](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form)
- Create a sample sign up form according to a [design](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png)

## Learning objectives
- Practice creating and styling forms with HTML & CSS
- Practice client-side form validation

## Notes
- The color for the ‘Create Account’ button is similar to tones found in the background image. Specifically, it is #596D48.
- The inputs, by default have a very light border (#E5E7EB), but we’ve included 2 variations. For starters, the password inputs should be given an error class.
- The other variation is the selected input, which should have a blue border and subtle box-shadow. This can be done with the :focus pseudo-class
